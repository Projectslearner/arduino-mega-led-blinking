# LED Blinking

#### Project Overview

The LED Blinking project demonstrates how to create a simple blinking effect with an LED using an Arduino Mega. This project is an introductory exercise in controlling digital outputs with Arduino, showcasing the ability to turn an LED on and off at regular intervals.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Mega**
- **LED (any color)**
- **Resistor (appropriate value for the LED, typically 220 ohms)**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the LED to Arduino Mega:**
   - **LED Anode (Longer Leg)**: Connect to digital pin 13 (or any other digital pin)
   - **LED Cathode (Shorter Leg)**: Connect to GND through a current-limiting resistor (e.g., 220 ohms)

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the LED and resistor as per the connection diagram provided.
   - Ensure the resistor limits the current to the LED to prevent damage.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.
   - The LED will blink on and off, with each state lasting for 1 second.

#### Applications

- **Visual Indication:** Use LEDs for visual feedback in various electronic projects.
- **Basic Output Control:** Learn how to control digital outputs using Arduino's digitalWrite function.
- **Learning Platform:** Suitable for beginners to understand digital output concepts and timing.

#### Notes

- **Resistor Value:** Choose an appropriate resistor value to protect the LED from excess current.
- **LED Polarity:** Ensure correct polarity when connecting the LED (anode to positive, cathode to negative).
- **Expansion:** Experiment by modifying the delay durations to change the blink rate or incorporate additional LEDs with different blinking patterns.
